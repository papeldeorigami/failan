# Failan #

## Introduction ##

This is **EXPERIMENTAL** code, not working yet!  
This is a simple failure analysis system for industrial equipments.

## Development environment setup ##

Install nodejs

Install deployd
```npm install deployd```

We've adopted the following yeoman generators:

```generator-angular```

and bower packages:

* [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com)
* [AngularJS](angularjs.org)
* [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)

We've decided not yet to use workflow helpers like yeoman, grunt or bower and stylesheet preprocessors like SASS or LESS in order to reduce dependencies.  
We strongly recommend using the [Brackets](brackets.io) editor, though, because of its built-in live preview and other Web editing specific features.  
For storing data, we are still investigating some ["no-backend"](http://nobackend.org/solutions.html) technologies.
