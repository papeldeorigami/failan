## Introduction ##

This is **EXPERIMENTAL** code, not working yet!  
This is a very simple [FRACAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_reporting,_analysis,_and_corrective_action_system) system developed with the purpose of extending the team's knowledge on modern web development techniques.  
It is composed of a website and a mobile app targeted mainly on Android devices, althoug easily extensible to other devices.  

## Core technologies ##

This is our toolset:  
* [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com)
* [Node.js](nodejs.org)
* [AngularJS](angularjs.org)
* [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)

We've decided not yet to use workflow helpers like yeoman, grunt or bower and stylesheet preprocessors like SASS or LESS in order to reduce dependencies.  
We strongly recommend using the [Brackets](brackets.io) editor, though, because of its built-in live preview and other Web editing specific features.  
For the backend, we are still investigating some backendless technologies.
